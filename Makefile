# TODO: since generate-html is a phony target, the dat file will be generated on each run.
#       this is not an easy problem to solve, but I have no clue how to fix this other than
#       create another sub-makefile (such as I did for compression). For compression, this
#       was necessary due to the long time the compression takes. In this case it is fast enough
#       so I will fix this some time in the future.
