### Convenience

<p>Bruce Schneier gibt nat√ºrlich auch seine <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/06/trading_privacy_1.html">Meinung</a> zu der ganzen PRISM-Geschichte ab, unter anderem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the government demanded that we all carry tracking devices 24/7, we would rebel. Yet we all carry cell phones. If the government demanded that we deposit copies of all of our messages to each other with the police, we'd declare their actions unconstitutional. Yet we all use Gmail and Facebook messaging and SMS. If the government demanded that we give them access to all the photographs we take, and that we identify all of the people in them and tag them with locations, we'd refuse. Yet we do exactly that on Flickr and other sites.</p>
