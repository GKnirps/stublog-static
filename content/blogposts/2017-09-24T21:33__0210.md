Dear US citizens among my readers (I guess there are none, but you never know: I admit that I looked down on you because you elected that manchild Trump as president.

Now, the extrapolations for the Bundestagswahl today show that we have around 13% Nazis in the new Bundestag (making them the third strongest faction). Which means we have lost our moral high ground.

So please accept my apology for looking down at you. I'm sorry. Now let's make a deal: You oppose Trump and get rid of him in the next election, and we will do the same with the Nazis in Germany. Thank you for your attention.
