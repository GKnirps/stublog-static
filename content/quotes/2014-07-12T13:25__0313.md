 Everything is messed up, you can enter a goblin dark fortress and they start killing each other, go to a tower and the zombies kill the necromancers, walk around a friendly city and people run from you and children stab you in the back. Everyone spits at you, but always miss anyway, you can have a polite conversation and trade with a merchant while dodging his swinging knife. You pummel a bandit to death in front of his friends "Just now Urist McAdventure attacked Bandi Stealstuff" "It was inevitable".
