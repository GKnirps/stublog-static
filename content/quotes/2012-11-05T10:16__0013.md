*Ha!*

It'll take **more** than
 
- being tied to a lit keg of explosives
- and tossed into a pit of acid
- filled with mutant, acid-resistant flying piranhas
- equipped with flame-throwers and battle-axes
- while venomous mechanical, missile-launching *morris dancers*
- armed with liquid nitrogen harpoon guns are overhead; riding giant, rabid killer bees, with side-mounted death rays
 
to kill **Othar Tryggvassen!**
