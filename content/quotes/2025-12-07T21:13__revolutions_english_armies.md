So hopefully, you know have a better idea of what everyone is doing once these battles get going:

Pikemen will be jabbing away at each other trying to convinve the generals that they are actually fighting. Musketeers will be lined, blasting away at each other until they are out of ammo, whereupon they will start hitting each other over the head with their guns, the royalist cavalry will be charging into the parlamentary cavalry and then the parlamentary cavalry will be riding off in disarray and the dragoons will be trying to convince their officers to let us stay on our horses please.

The artillery is stuck in a bog.
