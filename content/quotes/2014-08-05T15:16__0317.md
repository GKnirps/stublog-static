<p>When I unretired [the fort], I had the cabinets all be unbuilt in the bedrooms, a wagon in my dining room, all the caravan guards were now part of my fort, almost everyone was in their bedrooms asleep, and the forgotten beast was hanging out in one of the unoccupied bedrooms. Also, the merchants from the caravans started going berserk a few seconds after I unpaused. I just assumed they all had one hell of a party.</p>
