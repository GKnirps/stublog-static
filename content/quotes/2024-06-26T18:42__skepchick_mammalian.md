This is a cool little poll some anthropologists did, in which they asked 65 mammalian biologists–by which I mean biologists who study mammals, not biologists who ARE mammals. I mean, I assume they are mammals but just to be clear the study doesn’t detail whether any of them are, like, Argonians or whatever.
