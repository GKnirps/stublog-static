Guys, we can't do a civil war even if we wanted to. The median age in the US is 38. I am 38. I am tired and weak and my wife won't let me Civil War except on weekends. Do you really think this generation has enough vacation days for this sort of thing?

We cannot pit brother against brother because scheduling 2 men who work and have kids for a single DAY is a non-starter. You want to campaign for [checks notes] FOUR YEARS?

Can you imagine doing a Civil War on zoom? 3 second lag and half the time your enemy can't even log in.
