 This is an engraving of a Scamps and a shoe by 'Toady One' Adams. The Scamps is striking a menacing pose. The shoe is making a plaintive gesture. The artwork relates to the mortal wounding of a shoe by a Scamps in the late Spring of 2009 during the umpteenth attempted siege of the living room by shoes.
